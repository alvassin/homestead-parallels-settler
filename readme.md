# Laravel Parallels Desktop Settler

Laravel Homestead does not have official support for Parallels Vagrant provider, that is much faster then VirtualBox.
This scripts build development environment with such support.

You can find pre-built boxes from this source at [Hashicorp website ](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/alvassin/boxes/homestead-parallels/versions/1.0.0).

To use pre-built box, use `vagrant init alvassin/homestead-parallels; vagrant up --provider parallels` command.
